<h2 id="ab">What is COVID-19?</h2>
<p style="font-size:100%" id="p1">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</br>

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.</br> 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</br>

COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.</br>

Most common symptoms:</br>

* fever.</br>
* dry cough.</br>
* tiredness.</br>
Less common symptoms:</br>

* aches and pains.</br>
* sore throat.</br>
* diarrhoea.</br>
* conjunctivitis.</br>
* headache.</br>
* loss of taste or smell.</br>
* a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes.</br>

Serious symptoms:</br>

* difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.</br>
* chest pain or pressure.</br>
* loss of speech or movement.</br>
Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms.  Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility.</br>

People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home. 

On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up 14 days.</p>

<h2 id="vac">Vaccine </h2>
<p style="font-size:100%" id="p2"> Trials have shown that experimental vaccines can train the immune system. Small studies have shown they can teach the body to make both antibodies, which prevent Covid from invading the body's cells, and T-cells, which kill infected cells.</br>

However, the biggest question of all - "Is this enough to protect me?" - remains unanswered.</br>

There are now 11 vaccines in the final stage of testing, However, this is also the crucial point where some experimental vaccines fail.</br>

Some of the studies have recruited all of their volunteers and we are just waiting for the results.</br>

The leading contenders are:</br>

* The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK</br>
* Pfizer and BioNTech in Germany</br>
* Moderna in the US</br>
* CanSino with the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology in China</br>
* Gamaleya Research Institute in Russia</br>
* Janssen</br>
* Beijing Institute of Biological Products and Sinopharm in China</br>
* Sinovac and Instituto Butantan in Brazil</br>
* Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Sinopharm in China</br>
* Novavax in the US</br>
It is worth noting that four coronaviruses already circulate in human beings. They cause common cold symptoms and we don't have vaccines for any of them.</p>
